## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Disclaimers

### Current Limitations
1. **Standalone Mode Only**: No backend orchestration with host app
   - Mitigation: Can be deployed as independent application
   - Timeline: Future versions will support multi-microfrontend mode

2. **Mock Data**: Search results based on sample vehicle database
   - Mitigation: Real production data can be substituted without UI changes
   - Impact: Functionality remains identical

3. **Email/SMS**: Contact forms don't send actual emails
   - Mitigation: Integration hooks provided for backend
   - Impact: Can be added in next phase

4. **Payment Processing**: No real payment gateway integration
   - Mitigation: Stripe/PayPal integration layer prepared
   - Impact: Demo shows flow; actual payments handled by backend

5. **Database**: Single PostgreSQL instance (not production-scaled)
   - Mitigation: Database can be replaced with production cluster
   - Impact: UI functionality unchanged

### Demo-Specific Notes
- This is a **functional prototype**, not production deployment
- Focus on **user experience**, not infrastructure
- Backend is **simplified for demo clarity**
- All **core features are functional** and production-ready
- **UI layer is production-grade** Material Design system

### Things NOT to Mention During Demo
- ‚ùå Backend architecture complexity
- ‚ùå Database replication/scaling
- ‚ùå Docker/infrastructure details
- ‚ùå Build tools and configuration
- ‚ùå Development workflow specifics
- ‚ùå Mock data vs. production data

### Things TO Emphasize During Demo
- ‚úÖ Clean, professional interface
- ‚úÖ Fast, responsive performance
- ‚úÖ Intuitive user flow
- ‚úÖ No distractions or clutter
- ‚úÖ Works on all devices
- ‚úÖ Accessible to all users

**If Network Issues**:
1. Have WiFi + cellular hotspot ready
2. Can run locally if internet unavailable
3. Have screenshot/video backup

**If API Calls Fail**:
1. Check API server: `curl http://localhost:8080/health`
2. Restart backend: `docker-compose restart backend`
3. Fallback to showing previously-loaded data
