## Frontend Testing Steps

### 1. Refresh the Browser
- Open http://localhost:3001
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Ctrl+F5)
- Open Developer Console (F12)

### 2. Check for Errors
- ‚úÖ No "404" errors for `/filtered/cities`
- ‚úÖ No "map is not a function" errors
- ‚úÖ All dropdowns load correctly

### 3. Test City Selection
1. **Without selecting any other filter**, click on the City dropdown
2. Verify you see all 40+ cities
3. Select "Cape Town"
4. Verify other dropdowns update (Make, Body Type, Fuel Type)
5. Select a Make (e.g., "Toyota")
6. Verify Models dropdown shows only Toyota models in Cape Town
7. Click Search
8. Verify results show only Toyota vehicles in Cape Town

### 4. Test Make-First Flow
1. Refresh page
2. Select Make: "BMW"
3. Verify Models dropdown populates
4. Select City: "Johannesburg"
5. Verify Models dropdown updates (may show fewer models)
6. Click Search
7. Verify results show BMW vehicles in Johannesburg

### 5. Test Dynamic Filtering
1. Refresh page
2. Select City: "Durban"
3. Note the available Makes
4. Select Body Type: "SUV"
5. Verify Makes dropdown updates
6. Select a Make
7. Verify Models dropdown shows only SUV models in Durban
8. Click Search
9. Verify results match all filters

## Expected Console Output

### ‚úÖ Good Console Output
```
Fetching dynamic ranges with params: make=Toyota
Retrieved filtered ranges successfully
SearchResults - API response: {vehicles: Array(20), pagination: {...}}
```

### ‚ùå Bad Console Output (Should NOT see these)
```
XHR GET http://localhost:8080/api/vehicles/filtered/cities [HTTP/1.1 404]
TypeError: (intermediate value).map is not a function
filters.cities.map is not a function
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting 404 errors
**Solution**: 
1. Verify backend service is running: `docker-compose ps`
2. Check service logs: `docker-compose logs workflowservice`
3. Restart service: `docker-compose restart workflowservice`

### Issue: Still getting "map is not a function"
**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check if frontend has the latest code with `|| []` safety checks

### Issue: Dropdowns not updating
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify API responses are returning arrays
3. Check network tab to see actual API responses

### Issue: Search returns no results
**Solution**:
1. Verify database has vehicles with cities: 
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles WHERE city_name IS NOT NULL;
   ```
2. Check if filters are too restrictive
3. Try searching with just one filter at a time

## Manual API Testing (Using Browser or Postman)

### Test All Filtered Endpoints

1. **Get all cities**
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/api/vehicles/cities
   ```

2. **Get cities for Toyota**
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/api/vehicles/filtered/cities?make=Toyota
   ```

3. **Get body types in Cape Town**
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/api/vehicles/filtered/body-types?city=Cape%20Town
   ```

4. **Get fuel types for BMW in Johannesburg**
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/api/vehicles/filtered/fuel-types?make=BMW&city=Johannesburg
   ```

5. **Get provinces with Hilux vehicles**
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/api/vehicles/filtered/provinces?model=Hilux
   ```

6. **Get all filters**
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/api/vehicles/filters
   ```
   Should include `cities` array in response

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Backend service rebuilt and running
- ‚úÖ `/filtered/cities` endpoint returns 200 OK
- ‚è≥ Frontend loads without console errors
- ‚è≥ City dropdown shows all cities
- ‚è≥ Selecting city updates other dropdowns
- ‚è≥ Search with city filter returns correct results
- ‚è≥ All filter combinations work correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh the frontend** in your browser (hard refresh)
2. **Open Developer Console** (F12) to monitor for errors
3. **Test the city dropdown** - should work now!
4. **Test various filter combinations**
5. **Report any remaining issues**

## Files to Check if Issues Persist

### Frontend
- `microfrontends/buying-flow/src/steps/VehicleSearch.tsx`
  - Line 324: `{(filters.makes || []).map(...`
  - Line 343: `{(filters.models || []).map(...`
  - Line 362: `{(filters.bodyTypes || []).map(...`
  - Line 381: `{(filters.fuelTypes || []).map(...`
  - Line 400: `{(filters.provinces || []).map(...`
  - Line 419: `{(filters.cities || []).map(...`

### Backend
- `VehicleController.java`
  - Line 315: `@RequestParam(required = false) String city`
  - Line 333: `@RequestParam(required = false) String city`
  - Line 351: `@RequestParam(required = false) String city`

## Database Verification

```sql
-- Check if vehicles have cities
SELECT city_name, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM vehicles 
WHERE city_name IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY city_name 
ORDER BY count DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Check total vehicles
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles;

-- Check vehicles in Cape Town
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles WHERE city_name = 'Cape Town';

-- Check Toyota vehicles in Johannesburg
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vehicles 
WHERE make_name = 'Toyota' AND city_name = 'Johannesburg';
```

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **Backend is ready** - Service rebuilt with all new endpoints
‚è≥ **Frontend needs refresh** - Hard refresh browser to load new code
üéØ **Ready for testing** - All components in place for city dynamic filtering

The main issue was that the backend service needed to be rebuilt with the new code. Now that it's done, the frontend should work correctly after a browser refresh!
