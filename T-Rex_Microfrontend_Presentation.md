## 2. What is T-Rex?

### Core Purpose
**T-Rex is a microfrontend-based vehicle marketplace application that enables seamless vehicle buying and selling workflows through any host website.**

### Primary Functions

#### 🚗 **Vehicle Buying Workflow**
- **Intent Selection**: Users choose buying vs selling
- **Vehicle Discovery**: Advanced search with filters (make, model, price, location, etc.)
- **Vehicle Selection**: Browse and compare vehicles from multiple sources
- **Lead Generation**: Capture buyer information and preferences
- **Confirmation**: Finalize purchase intent and dealer matching

#### 🏷️ **Vehicle Selling Workflow**
- **Buyer Assessment**: Determine if seller has a buyer or needs dealer network
- **Buyer Type Classification**: Private buyer vs dealer transaction
- **Financing Evaluation**: Credit check and financing assistance
- **Replacement Planning**: Help sellers find replacement vehicles
- **Dealer Integration**: Connect with dealer network for best offers

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: React microfrontend with Material UI components
- **Backend**: Spring Boot workflow orchestration engine
- **Architecture**: Backend-driven workflow with thin client frontend
- **Integration**: Single-SPA for seamless host website embedding

### 🔧 Backend-Driven Workflow Orchestration

#### Why Backend-Driven?
1. **Security**: All business logic centralized and protected
2. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for workflow logic
3. **Consistency**: Uniform behavior across all frontend instances
4. **Scalability**: Backend scales independently from frontend
5. **Integration**: Easy to integrate with external services

#### Workflow Engine Components

**Workflow Definitions** (`BuyingWorkflowDefinition.java`)
```java
// Centralized workflow logic
- Intent Selection → Vehicle Search → Results → Confirmation
- State management and transitions
- Validation rules and business logic
- Navigation history and back functionality
```

**State Management**
- Session-based workflow state persistence
- PostgreSQL for reliable state storage
- Redis caching for performance
- Event-driven state transitions

**API Contracts**
```typescript
// Clean separation between frontend and backend
POST /api/workflow/start     // Initialize session
POST /api/workflow/transition // Process step transitions
POST /api/workflow/back      // Navigate backwards
```

### 🎨 Frontend Architecture

#### Microfrontend Benefits
- **Independent Deployment**: Frontend and backend deploy separately
- **Technology Agnostic**: Host website can use any technology stack
- **Progressive Loading**: Components load on-demand
- **Shared Libraries**: Reusable UI components across workflows

#### Component Structure
