# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Vehicle Selection Display & Contact Request Form

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 30, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (Multi-vehicle display, Remove mock data, Form validation, Clean layout)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Quality Assessment Details

### Content Quality Analysis

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification avoids mentioning React, TypeScript, specific APIs, or technical implementation patterns. Uses technology-agnostic language throughout.

✅ **Business-focused**: Requirements emphasize user value (preventing confusion, improving data quality, professional appearance) rather than technical implementation.

✅ **Non-technical stakeholders**: Written clearly with plain language, specific examples, and visual references that non-technical stakeholders can understand.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: Includes User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, and Design Considerations.

### Requirement Completeness Analysis

✅ **No clarification markers**: All 4 user stories have clear acceptance criteria. All 11 functional requirements are concrete and unambiguous.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each requirement specifies measurable observable behavior:
- FR-001: "ALL selected vehicles" - testable by counting displayed vehicles
- FR-002: "no mock/prepopulated data" - testable by inspecting form values
- FR-003: Validation requirements specify exact fields and validation rules
- FR-004-011: All specify measurable, observable outcomes

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: Each success criterion includes quantifiable metrics:
- SC-001: "100% of their selected vehicles"
- SC-004: "within 500ms"
- SC-005: "under 2 minutes"
- SC-009: "40% improvement"

✅ **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria focus on user-facing outcomes (completion time, error visibility, visual consistency) not technical implementation (API response times, database queries, framework-specific metrics).

✅ **Acceptance scenarios**: All 4 user stories include 4-6 specific Given-When-Then scenarios each, providing clear test cases.

✅ **Edge cases**: 7 edge cases identified covering boundaries (0, 4+), failure scenarios (backend errors), navigation patterns (back button), and data handling.

✅ **Scope boundaries**: Feature scope is clearly limited to contact request page improvements (not vehicle selection, not backend service modifications, not dealership information display).

✅ **Assumptions documented**: 7 key assumptions recorded including international phone formats, Province-City relationships, design system availability, and maximum vehicle limit.

### Feature Readiness Analysis

✅ **Requirements → Criteria mapping**: Each functional requirement maps to success criteria:
- FR-001 (display all vehicles) → SC-001 (100% visible)
- FR-002 (remove mock data) → SC-002 (zero prepopulated fields)
- FR-003 (validation) → SC-003 (catch 100% invalid submissions)

✅ **User journey coverage**: 4 prioritized user stories represent complete buying flow at contact request stage:
- P1: Multi-vehicle display (core functionality)
- P1: Remove mock data (data quality)
- P1: Form validation (error handling)
- P1: Clean layout (UI/UX consistency)

✅ **Independent testability**: Each user story can be tested independently and delivers standalone value.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification contains no mention of:
- React, TypeScript, or JavaScript frameworks
- Specific API endpoints or status codes
- Database schemas or design patterns
- Component architecture or state management
- CSS frameworks or styling libraries

## Sign-Off

**Validation Status**: ✅ **PASS - Ready for Planning**

All checklist items are complete. The specification is:
- Clear and unambiguous
- Testable and measurable
- User-focused and business-valuable
- Free of implementation details
- Ready for planning phase

**Next Step**: Proceed to `/speckit.clarify` for any refinements, or `/speckit.plan` to create implementation planning tasks.
