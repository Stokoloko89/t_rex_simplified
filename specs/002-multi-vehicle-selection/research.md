# Phase 0: Research & Technical Findings

**Feature**: Multi-Vehicle Selection Display & Contact Request Form  
**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for team review and validation

## Research Findings

### 0.1: Existing Contact Request API Structure

**Decision**: Extend existing contact request endpoint to support vehicles array parameter

**Rationale**: 
- Backend workflowservice already has contact request handling
- API endpoint: `POST /api/contact-requests` 
- Existing schema includes dealership anonymity logic (30-minute delay)
- Schema is extensible to accommodate vehicles array without breaking changes

**Current API Contract** (existing):
```json
{
  "fullName": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "phone": "string",
  "vehicleId": "single number",
  "dealershipId": "hidden from user"
}
```

**Proposed Enhancement**:
```json
{
  "fullName": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "phone": "string",
  "province": "string",
  "city": "string",
  "preferredContactMethod": "email|phone|whatsapp",
  "additionalComments": "string",
  "selectedVehicles": [
    {
      "vehicleId": "number",
      "make": "string",
      "model": "string",
      "year": "number",
      "price": "number"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation Impact**: 
- Backend: Modify `ContactRequest` entity to include vehicles collection
- Database: Add foreign key relationship or JSON array field
- Validation: Ensure 1-4 vehicles submitted
- Complexity: **Low** - follows existing pattern

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Create separate endpoint for multi-vehicle requests → Rejected: Unnecessary duplication
- Multiple API calls (one per vehicle) → Rejected: Inefficient, increases failure points
- Client-side aggregation before submission → Current approach: Simple and correct

### 0.2: Form Validation Library Selection

**Decision**: React Hook Form (already available in project or recommended for addition)

**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and performant (critical for form with validation feedback < 500ms)
- Minimal re-renders (aligns with React 18 performance goals)
- Built-in async validation support for backend verification
- Integrates well with Material-UI components
- Industry standard for React applications
- Easy to test and maintain

**Current State**: 
- T-Rex codebase may already use React Hook Form or similar
- If not present: Add to `microfrontends/buying-flow/package.json`
- Version: ^7.48.0 or latest stable

**Validation Strategy**:
- Frontend: Real-time validation on blur/change (UX feedback)
- Backend: Authoritative validation on submit (data integrity)
- Error handling: Display field-level errors with clear messages

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Formik → Rejected: Heavier library, more boilerplate
- HTML5 native validation → Rejected: Insufficient browser consistency
- Custom validation → Rejected: Don't reinvent the wheel, maintenance burden

**Implementation Impact**:
- Learning curve: Minimal (team familiar with form libraries)
- Complexity: **Low-Medium** - straightforward integration with existing components
- Testing: Well-established testing patterns for React Hook Form

### 0.3: Material Design Component Library & Vehicle Card Reusability

**Decision**: Reuse existing Vehicle Card component from vehicle selection page; ensure Material-UI version compatibility

**Findings**:
- T-Rex uses Material-UI (MUI) as primary component library
- Theme tokens available in `packages/shared-ui/src/theme/theme.ts`
- Vehicle Card component exists in buying-flow and can be extracted to shared-ui if needed
- Existing vehicle display patterns:
  - Show: Make, Model, Year, Price, Location, Mileage, Transmission, Fuel Type, Color, Body Type, Image
  - Selected state: Blue "Selected" badge visible
  - Rating: "Excellent" badge in green
  - Condition tags: Used/condition metadata

**Approach**:
1. **If Vehicle Card is currently in buying-flow only**:
   - Extract to `packages/shared-ui/src/components/VehicleCard.tsx`
   - Version as shared component with props for display modes
   - Import in both vehicle selection and contact request pages

2. **If Vehicle Card already in shared-ui**:
   - Reuse directly in contact request page
   - No extraction needed

**Material Design Compliance**:
- Spacing: 4px grid (8px margins between items, 16px padding within cards)
- Typography: Use MUI theme typography scales (H1, H2, Body1, Body2, Caption)
- Colors: Primary (blue), Secondary (accent), Success (green), Error (red)
- Shadows: MUI elevation levels 1-4 for card hierarchy

**Implementation Impact**:
- Complexity: **Very Low** - component reuse, no new component development
- Testing: Inherit existing VehicleCard tests
- Maintenance: Central location for updates benefits both pages

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Create new component just for contact request → Rejected: Violates DRY principle, design inconsistency
- Inline vehicle display in form → Rejected: Code duplication, maintenance burden

### 0.4: Backend Database Schema & Multi-Vehicle Support

**Decision**: Add vehicles collection to contact_requests table (JSON array or separate junction table)

**Current Schema** (assumed):
```sql
CREATE TABLE contact_requests (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  dealership_id INT,
  full_name VARCHAR,
  email VARCHAR,
  phone VARCHAR,
  vehicle_id INT (SINGLE VEHICLE),
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  status VARCHAR
);
```

**Proposed Schema Enhancement**:

**Option A: JSON Array (PostgreSQL jsonb)**
```sql
ALTER TABLE contact_requests 
ADD COLUMN selected_vehicles JSONB DEFAULT '[]';

-- Stores:
{
  "vehicles": [
    {
      "vehicleId": 123,
      "make": "Toyota",
      "model": "Starlet",
      "year": 2022,
      "price": 458171
    },
    { ... }
  ]
}
```

**Option B: Separate Junction Table (Normalized)**
```sql
CREATE TABLE contact_request_vehicles (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  contact_request_id INT FOREIGN KEY,
  vehicle_id INT FOREIGN KEY,
  make VARCHAR,
  model VARCHAR,
  year INT,
  price DECIMAL,
  INDEX idx_contact_request
);
```

**Recommendation**: Option B (Normalized approach)
- **Rationale**: 
  - Supports queries like "which contact requests include vehicle X"
  - Better for analytics and reporting
  - Referential integrity via foreign keys
  - Easier to maintain and evolve

**Implementation Impact**:
- Database: New table or column addition
- ORM: Update ContactRequest entity in backend
- Migration: Write database migration script
- Complexity: **Low-Medium** - standard database enhancement

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep single vehicle_id, reject multi-vehicle submissions → Rejected: Violates feature requirements
- Store as comma-separated string → Rejected: Query difficulty, data integrity risks

### 0.5: Mobile Responsive Breakpoints & Testing Devices

**Decision**: Support mobile-first responsive design with tested breakpoints

**Breakpoints** (Material Design):
- **xs**: 0px (phones, 360px to 600px)
- **sm**: 600px (tablets in portrait)
- **md**: 960px (tablets in landscape, small desktops)
- **lg**: 1264px (desktops)
- **xl**: 1920px (large displays)

**Target Devices** (from specification):
- **Mobile**: iPhone 12 (390px width) and larger
- **Tablet**: iPad (768px width, landscape mode)
- **Desktop**: Standard desktop browsers (1024px+)

**Testing Matrix**:
| Device | Width | Orientation | Test Focus |
|--------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| iPhone 12 | 390px | Portrait | Touch usability, form fields, vehicle card stacking |
| iPhone 14 Pro Max | 430px | Portrait | Larger mobile, edge case |
| iPad (6th Gen) | 768px | Portrait + Landscape | Tablet responsiveness, form layout |
| Desktop | 1024px+ | - | Desktop layout, multi-column form |

**Responsive Strategy**:
- **Mobile (xs-sm)**: Single column, full-width vehicle cards, vertical form stack
- **Tablet (md)**: Two-column grid, form sections side-by-side if space allows
- **Desktop (lg+)**: Vehicle list on left, form on right (2-column layout)

**Implementation Impact**:
- Complexity: **Low-Medium** - use MUI Grid and responsive utilities
- Testing: E2E tests cover all breakpoints via Cypress
- Browser support: Chrome, Safari, Firefox (modern versions)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Mobile-only first implementation → Rejected: Violates responsive requirement
- Separate mobile app → Rejected: Not in scope; web-responsive sufficient
