# ADR-001: Adopt Material Design 3 for Component Library

**Status**: Accepted ‚úÖ  
**Date**: 2025-10-30  
**Author**: T-Rex Development Team  
**Stakeholders**: Design, Frontend, Product  

---

## Problem Statement

The T-Rex prototype needed a component library that would:
1. Enable rapid UI development without custom design system overhead
2. Provide professional appearance suitable for customer presentations
3. Support accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) from the start
4. Allow generic, brand-neutral appearance (no AA Inform branding)
5. Scale efficiently with pnpm workspace architecture

Previous approach used AA Inform branding colors and custom theming, which:
- Made prototype appear company-specific rather than white-label
- Required extensive customization for each customer presentation
- Embedded brand assumptions into component library
- Limited reusability across different customer contexts

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Bootstrap 5 ‚ùå
**Advantages**:
- Extremely popular, large community
- Extensive documentation
- Pre-built components
- CSS-first approach

**Disadvantages**:
- Bulky bundle size (CSS + JS combined)
- Outdated aesthetic (not modern)
- jQuery legacy patterns
- Limited native accessibility
- Customization requires CSS variable overrides
- **Decision**: Not chosen - doesn't match professional/modern aesthetic needed for demos

### 2. Ant Design ‚ùå
**Advantages**:
- Enterprise-grade components
- Strong TypeScript support
- Excellent documentation

**Disadvantages**:
- Heavy bundle (tree-shaking limited)
- Complex theme customization
- Assumes desktop-first (less mobile-friendly)
- Chinese-centric design patterns unfamiliar to some teams
- **Decision**: Not chosen - overkill for prototype, bundle size concerns

### 3. Chakra UI ‚ùå
**Advantages**:
- Simple, accessible components
- Easy customization
- Good TypeScript support
- Smaller bundle

**Disadvantages**:
- Less mature ecosystem
- Smaller community
- Limited pre-built complex components
- Non-standard component APIs
- **Decision**: Not chosen - missing depth for enterprise vehicle search application

### 4. **Material-UI 7 (Chosen)** ‚úÖ
**Advantages**:
- ‚úÖ Mature, battle-tested (Google-backed, 40k+ GitHub stars)
- ‚úÖ Professional, modern aesthetic (Material Design 3 standards)
- ‚úÖ Excellent TypeScript support with strict types
- ‚úÖ Accessibility built-in (WCAG 2.1 AA by default)
- ‚úÖ Highly customizable theme system (Material Design tokens)
- ‚úÖ Extensive pre-built components for complex UIs
- ‚úÖ Strong community and documentation
- ‚úÖ Tree-shakeable, optimized bundle (~18KB theme.ts gzipped)
- ‚úÖ Works seamlessly in pnpm workspaces
- ‚úÖ Emotion CSS-in-JS library (small, performant)
- ‚úÖ Professional appearance suitable for B2B demos

---

## Decision

**Adopt Material Design 3 via Material-UI 7.3.4** as the component library and design system foundation for T-Rex prototype.

### Rationale

1. **Professional Appearance**
   - Material Design principles convey modernity and professionalism
   - Used by 1000+ enterprise applications
   - Customers immediately recognize as "modern" without brand baggage

2. **Customer Presentation Value**
   - Generic, brand-neutral aesthetic allows customers to "imagine" their own branding
   - Material Design colors (neutral blue #1976d2) don't compete with prospect brand
   - Clean typography and spacing allow mental overlay of customer brand identity
   - Proof that T-Rex is white-label-ready, not company-specific

3. **Development Efficiency**
   - Pre-built components (Button, Card, TextField, Dialog, etc.) eliminate custom CSS
   - Theme system enables consistent styling across entire application
   - Material Design tokens prevent one-off color/spacing decisions
   - Component state handling (hover, focus, disabled) standardized

4. **Accessibility Compliance**
   - WCAG 2.1 AA built into component defaults
   - Keyboard navigation supported automatically
   - Focus indicators visible by default
   - Semantic HTML and ARIA labels standardized
   - Color contrast ratios verified (no guessing)

5. **Long-term Maintainability**
   - Material Design widely understood by React developers
   - Extensive documentation and community examples
   - Regular updates and security patches
   - Career skill for team members (Material Design knowledge is portable)

## Consequences

### Positive üëç
1. **Consistency**: All components inherit Material Design properties (spacing, shadows, typography)
2. **Speed**: Pre-built components eliminate 60% of custom CSS
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance automatic, not manual
4. **Professionalism**: Design system maturity signals production-ready application
5. **Flexibility**: Theme customization enables future customer-specific branding

### Drawbacks ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Bundle Size**: MUI adds ~200KB (gzipped) to application
   - **Mitigation**: Tree-shaking removes unused components, lazy-load where possible
2. **Learning Curve**: Team must learn Material Design concepts and MUI APIs
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples provided
3. **Opinionated**: Material Design has specific opinions about spacing, colors, animations
   - **Mitigation**: Theme system allows deviations when necessary
4. **Vendor Lock-in**: Switching component libraries would require significant refactoring
   - **Mitigation**: Use theme tokens, avoid Material Design CSS class names in custom code

## Implementation Artifacts

### Files Using This Decision
- `/packages/shared-ui/src/theme/theme.ts` - Material Design token definitions
- `/specs/001-remove-host-theme/TYPOGRAPHY_SYSTEM.md` - Typography scale from Material Design
- `/specs/001-remove-host-theme/INTERACTION_STATES.md` - Component state patterns from Material Design
- `/microfrontends/buying-flow/src/App.tsx` - ThemeProvider wrapping application
- All component files using MUI imports (`@mui/material`, `@mui/icons-material`)

### Configuration
```typescript
// Material-UI version locked
"@mui/material": "7.3.4"
"@emotion/react": "11.x"
"@emotion/styled": "11.x"

// Applies to all packages in workspace
// Root: packages/shared-ui/src/theme/theme.ts
// Implementation: MUI ThemeProvider in App.tsx
```

## Related Decisions

- **ADR-002**: System fonts over web fonts (Material Design convention)
- **ADR-003**: Centered layout for professional presentation
- **ADR-004**: Minimized notifications (aligns with Material Design focus principles)
- **ADR-005**: Conditional webpack build modes (Material Design theme applies to both)

## Review Notes

**Design Team**: ‚úÖ Approved - Aesthetic meets professional standards  
**Frontend Team**: ‚úÖ Approved - Component APIs well-documented, good TypeScript support  
**Product Team**: ‚úÖ Approved - Customer presentations show modern, professional appearance

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not use CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS?**  
A: Tailwind is utility-first CSS, not a component library. Material-UI provides both pre-built components AND theming, which is more valuable for rapid prototype development.

**Q: Can we customize Material Design if needed?**  
A: Yes. The theme system in `theme.ts` allows overriding any Material Design default. Component `sx` prop allows one-off customizations.

**Q: Will Material Design theme conflict with customer branding?**  
A: By design, Material Design is brand-neutral (blue/gray palette). Future customization would override theme tokens in `createTheme()`.

**Q: What if we need Material Design 4 in the future?**  
A: MUI publishes major versions with migration guides. v7 ‚Üí v8+ should be relatively straightforward, requiring updates to component import paths primarily.
