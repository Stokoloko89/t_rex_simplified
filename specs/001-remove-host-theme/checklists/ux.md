## Summary

**Total Items**: 84  
**Focus Areas**:
- ✅ Requirement Completeness (15 items)
- ✅ Requirement Clarity (10 items)
- ✅ Requirement Consistency (8 items)
- ✅ Acceptance Criteria Quality (7 items)
- ✅ Scenario Coverage (10 items)
- ✅ Edge Case Coverage (8 items)
- ✅ Non-Functional Requirements (7 items)
- ✅ Dependencies & Assumptions (7 items)
- ✅ Ambiguities & Conflicts (6 items)
- ✅ Documentation & Decision Records (6 items)

**Traceability**: 78/84 items (92.8%) include spec section references or Gap markers

**Key Findings**:
1. **High Priority Gaps**: Typography, interaction states, form validation, and loading states are not defined
2. **Clarity Issues**: Key UX terms ("professional", "clean", "visual hierarchy") lack quantifiable definitions
3. **Coverage Gaps**: Error states, edge cases, and alternate flows need visual specification
4. **Assumption Validation**: Several critical assumptions about design approach should be documented

**Note**: This checklist validates the QUALITY of UX requirements in the specification. Each item tests whether requirements are complete, clear, consistent, and measurable - NOT whether the implementation works correctly.
