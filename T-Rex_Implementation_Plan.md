## 🤔 Key Discussion Points

### 1. Architecture Decisions Validation

#### Backend-Driven Workflow Orchestration
**Discussion Question:** Are we confident this approach provides the right balance of security, maintainability, and user experience?

**Pros to Highlight:**
- ✅ Single source of truth for business logic
- ✅ Enhanced security through server-side validation
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all frontend instances
- ✅ Easier maintenance and updates

**Potential Concerns:**
- 🔍 Dependency on backend availability
- 🔍 API response times affecting UX
- 🔍 Complexity of state synchronization

**Decision Needed:** Confirm this is the right architectural approach or identify modifications needed.

#### Microfrontend vs Monolithic Approach
**Discussion Question:** Does Single-SPA provide sufficient benefits to justify the complexity?

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Independent deployment capabilities
- ✅ Technology stack flexibility for host websites
- ✅ Progressive loading and performance optimization
- ✅ Reusable components across different host applications

**Alternatives to Consider:**
- Traditional SPA with iframe embedding
- Module federation approach
- Complete microfrontend abandonment for simpler SPA

### 2. Technical Priorities & Trade-offs

#### Immediate Technical Debt
**High Priority Issues:**
1. **Selling Flow Completion** - Core functionality gap
2. **Testing Coverage** - Quality assurance risk
3. **Error Handling** - User experience impact
4. **Performance Optimization** - Scalability concerns

**Medium Priority Issues:**
1. **Monitoring Setup** - Operational visibility
2. **Documentation** - Knowledge transfer
3. **Security Hardening** - Production readiness

#### Performance vs Features Debate
**Question:** Should we prioritize performance optimization or feature completion?

**Option A: Feature-First**
- Complete all workflow steps
- Ensure end-to-end functionality
- Add performance optimization later

**Option B: Performance-First**
- Optimize current workflows
- Implement caching and monitoring
- Add features to optimized base

**Recommendation:** Balanced approach - complete critical features while implementing key optimizations.

### 3. Team Structure & Responsibilities

#### Current Team Allocation
```
Backend Team (3 developers):
├── Workflow Engine & API Development
├── Database Design & Optimization
└── External Service Integrations

Frontend Team (2 developers):
├── React Components & UI Development
├── Single-SPA Integration
└── Shared Component Library

DevOps Team (1 engineer):
├── Docker & Infrastructure Setup
├── CI/CD Pipeline Planning
└── Monitoring Implementation
```

#### Proposed Adjustments
**Potential Reallocation:**
- **Backend Team**: Add 1 developer for external integrations
- **Frontend Team**: Add 1 developer for testing and quality assurance
- **DevOps Team**: Maintain current structure but add monitoring focus

**Cross-Training Opportunities:**
- Frontend developers learning backend API patterns
- Backend developers understanding React component lifecycle
- DevOps engineers participating in code reviews

### 4. Risk Management & Mitigation

#### Technical Risks
1. **External API Dependencies**
   - **Risk**: Vehicle data APIs unavailable
   - **Mitigation**: Circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms
   - **Owner**: Backend Team

2. **State Management Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Workflow state synchronization issues
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and validation
   - **Owner**: All Teams

3. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - **Risk**: Slow API responses affecting UX
   - **Mitigation**: Caching strategy and query optimization
   - **Owner**: Backend & DevOps Teams

#### Business Risks
1. **Integration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Host websites unable to integrate easily
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
   - **Owner**: Frontend Team

2. **Dealer Network Partnerships**
   - **Risk**: Limited dealer adoption
   - **Mitigation**: Early engagement and feedback sessions
   - **Owner**: Business Team
